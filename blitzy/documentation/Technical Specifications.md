# Technical Specifications

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The IndiVillage.com website redesign project aims to create a modern, visually stunning digital platform that effectively showcases the company's AI-as-a-service and scalable back-office capabilities. The current website fails to adequately represent IndiVillage's technological sophistication and social impact mission, limiting customer engagement and business growth.

Key stakeholders include potential enterprise clients seeking AI solutions, the IndiVillage leadership team, technical implementation teams, and the communities benefiting from IndiVillage's social impact initiatives. The primary users will be prospective clients, existing customers, potential employees, and those interested in IndiVillage's social mission.

The redesigned website is expected to increase qualified leads by at least 30%, improve conversion rates for demo requests, strengthen brand perception as a technology leader, and better communicate IndiVillage's dual mission of providing cutting-edge AI services while creating positive social impact.

### SYSTEM OVERVIEW

| Business Context | IndiVillage operates in the competitive AI services market with a unique "AI for Good" value proposition, combining technical excellence with social impact. |
| Current Limitations | The existing website lacks modern design elements, interactive capabilities for customer engagement, and fails to effectively communicate the company's dual mission. |
| Enterprise Integration | The new website must integrate with existing CRM systems, data security protocols, and marketing automation tools while maintaining brand consistency across digital properties. |

#### High-Level Description

The new IndiVillage.com will be a responsive, user-centric website showcasing the company's AI capabilities and social impact initiatives. The system will feature:

- Interactive elements allowing potential clients to upload sample datasets
- Automated quote/demo request functionality
- Compelling presentation of the "AI for Good" social impact story

The architecture will employ a headless CMS approach with a modern frontend framework, RESTful APIs for system integration, and secure cloud infrastructure for data handling and storage.

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The IndiVillage.com website will implement a modern, decoupled architecture following the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) approach. This architecture was selected for its ability to deliver exceptional performance, security, and scalability while enabling a rich, interactive user experience.

Key architectural principles include:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Decoupling the presentation layer from business logic and data services
- **API-First Design**: All data interactions occur through well-defined APIs
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced experiences for modern browsers
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated throughout the architecture
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging CDN, caching, and optimized assets for fast global delivery

The system boundaries encompass the website frontend, content management system, backend services for data processing, and integration points with external systems like CRM and analytics platforms. Major interfaces include the content API, form submission endpoints, file upload services, and CRM integration interfaces.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Frontend Application | Deliver user interface and handle client-side interactions | Next.js, React, TailwindCSS | Performance optimization, accessibility, SEO |
| Content Management System | Store and deliver structured content | Contentful, Content API | Content modeling, editorial workflow, versioning |
| API Gateway | Route and secure API requests | AWS API Gateway, Auth Service | Rate limiting, request validation, authentication |
| Form Processing Service | Handle and validate form submissions | API Gateway, CRM Integration | Data validation, spam prevention, error handling |
| File Upload Service | Process and store user-uploaded datasets | S3, Security Scanner, File Processor | Security scanning, file size limits, format validation |
| CRM Integration Service | Synchronize lead data with CRM | HubSpot API, Queue Service | Data mapping, error recovery, rate limiting |
| Analytics Service | Track user behavior and site performance | Google Analytics, Tag Manager | Privacy compliance, data accuracy, performance impact |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The primary data flow begins with content delivery, where the CMS provides structured content to the frontend application via its API. This content is pre-rendered where possible using Next.js's static site generation capabilities, with dynamic content fetched client-side as needed.

User interactions trigger client-side validations before submitting data to backend services. Form submissions flow through the API Gateway to the Form Processing Service, which validates the data and forwards it to the CRM Integration Service. This service transforms the data to match CRM requirements and submits it to HubSpot via its API.

File uploads follow a more complex path: files are first validated client-side, then uploaded directly to S3 using pre-signed URLs. The File Upload Service is notified of new uploads, triggering security scanning before processing. Processed files are stored in a secure S3 bucket, with metadata stored in a database and linked to the user's CRM record.

Analytics data flows from the frontend to Google Analytics, with custom events tracking key user interactions. This data is used for reporting and optimization.

Key data stores include the CMS content repository, the file storage S3 buckets, and the CRM system. Redis caching is employed at critical points to improve performance, particularly for frequently accessed content and API responses.

#### 5.1.4 External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Contentful CMS | Content Delivery | Pull (API Requests) | REST/JSON | 99.9% availability, <500ms response time |
| HubSpot CRM | Lead Management | Push (Webhook) | REST/JSON | 99.5% availability, <2s processing time |
| AWS S3 | File Storage | Push/Pull | HTTPS | 99.99% availability, <1s upload initiation |
| Google Analytics | User Tracking | Push (Events) | HTTPS/JSON | 99% availability, non-critical |
| Email Service | Notifications | Push (API Requests) | SMTP/REST | 99.5% availability, <5min delivery time |
| reCAPTCHA | Security | Request/Response | REST/JSON | 99.5% availability, <1s verification time |

### 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Selected Approach | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Overall Architecture | Monolithic, Microservices, JAMstack | JAMstack with decoupled services | Better performance, security, and developer experience for content-focused site |
| Frontend Approach | SPA, MPA, SSR, SSG | Next.js (SSG+SSR hybrid) | Combines SEO benefits of server rendering with interactive capabilities of SPAs |
| CMS Selection | Traditional CMS, Headless CMS, Custom CMS | Headless CMS (Contentful) | Content flexibility, API-first approach, separation of concerns |
| API Design | REST, GraphQL, RPC | REST with JSON | Wider adoption, simpler implementation, sufficient for requirements |

The JAMstack architecture was selected as it provides an optimal balance of performance, security, and developer experience for a content-focused website with interactive elements. By pre-rendering static content and delivering it via CDN, we achieve exceptional performance while maintaining the ability to incorporate dynamic features through APIs.

Next.js was chosen as the frontend framework due to its hybrid approach, combining static site generation (SSG) for content-heavy pages with server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic content. This approach optimizes both performance and SEO while enabling rich interactive experiences.

A headless CMS (Contentful) was selected over traditional CMS options to provide content flexibility, an API-first approach, and clear separation of concerns. This allows content editors to work independently from developers and enables a more structured approach to content modeling.

    A[Architecture Decision] --> B{Website Type}
    B -->|Content-focused with interactive elements| C[JAMstack]
    B -->|Highly dynamic application| D[SPA with API Backend]
    B -->|Simple content site| E[Static Site Generator]
    
    C --> F{Frontend Framework}
    F -->|SEO + Interactive needs| G[Next.js]
    F -->|Pure client-side| H[React SPA]
    
    G --> I{CMS Approach}
    I -->|Flexible content model| J[Headless CMS]
    I -->|Simple content needs| K[Markdown files]
    I -->|Complex workflows| L[Traditional CMS]
    
    J --> M[Contentful Selected]
```

#### 5.3.2 Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Use Case | Implementation | Benefits |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Request-Response | Form submissions, Content retrieval | REST API calls | Simplicity, immediate feedback |
| Event-Driven | File processing, CRM updates | Message queue, Webhooks | Decoupling, resilience |
| Publish-Subscribe | Content updates, Analytics | Webhooks, Event bus | Scalability, loose coupling |
| Circuit Breaker | External API calls | Resilience libraries | Fault tolerance, graceful degradation |

For form submissions and content retrieval, we've selected the Request-Response pattern implemented via REST APIs due to its simplicity and immediate feedback. This pattern is well-suited for synchronous interactions where users expect immediate responses.

For longer-running processes like file processing and CRM updates, we've chosen an Event-Driven approach using message queues and webhooks. This pattern decouples the components, improving resilience and allowing for asynchronous processing.

Content updates and analytics tracking will use a Publish-Subscribe pattern, enabling multiple consumers to react to events without tight coupling. This improves scalability and flexibility as new consumers can be added without modifying publishers.

To handle potential failures in external API calls, we'll implement the Circuit Breaker pattern using resilience libraries. This prevents cascading failures and enables graceful degradation when external systems are unavailable.

| Data Type | Storage Solution | Key Considerations | Alternatives Considered |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Content | Contentful CMS | Structured content, API access, CDN delivery | WordPress, Custom DB, Strapi |
| User Files | AWS S3 | Durability, scalability, security | Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage |
| Form Data | Transient (API → CRM) | No need for persistent storage, CRM is system of record | Database storage, Document DB |
| Analytics | Google Analytics | Comprehensive tracking, no self-hosting needed | Self-hosted analytics, Log analysis |

Content data will be stored in Contentful CMS, chosen for its structured content model, robust API access, and CDN-backed delivery. This provides better performance and content management capabilities compared to alternatives like WordPress or custom database solutions.

User-uploaded files will be stored in AWS S3, selected for its exceptional durability (99.999999999%), scalability, and security features. S3's lifecycle policies also enable automatic management of temporary files.

Form submission data will be treated as transient, flowing directly from the API to the CRM system without persistent storage in our architecture. This simplifies the system and maintains the CRM as the single source of truth for customer data.

Analytics data will be stored in Google Analytics, eliminating the need for self-hosted analytics infrastructure while providing comprehensive tracking capabilities. This data will be used for reporting and optimization without adding storage requirements to our system.

#### 5.3.4 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Use Case | Invalidation Strategy |
|------------|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| Content Cache | CDN (CloudFront) | Static assets, pre-rendered pages | Time-based + CMS webhooks |
| API Response Cache | Redis | Frequently accessed API responses | Time-based + write-through |
| Browser Cache | HTTP headers | Static assets, page components | Cache-Control headers |
| Application Cache | Memory cache | UI components, form state | Component lifecycle |

Our caching strategy employs multiple layers to optimize performance. At the outermost layer, a CDN cache (AWS CloudFront) will store static assets and pre-rendered pages, dramatically improving global load times. This cache will be invalidated based on time and CMS update webhooks.

For API responses, we'll implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data, reducing load on backend services and improving response times. This cache will use a combination of time-based expiration and write-through invalidation when data changes.

Browser caching will be optimized through appropriate HTTP headers, allowing static assets and page components to be stored locally on user devices. Cache-Control headers will be carefully configured to balance freshness and performance.

At the application level, we'll implement memory caching for UI components and form state, improving the responsiveness of the user interface without unnecessary re-rendering or API calls.

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The monitoring and observability strategy for IndiVillage.com will provide comprehensive visibility into system health, performance, and user experience. We will implement a multi-layered approach:

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Tracking actual user experiences including page load times, interaction delays, and client-side errors
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Tracking backend service performance, API response times, and resource utilization
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Tracking server health, resource utilization, and availability
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Regular automated tests simulating user journeys to detect issues proactively

Key metrics to be monitored include:
- Page load performance (Time to First Byte, First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive)
- API response times and error rates
- File upload success rates and processing times
- Form submission completion rates
- Infrastructure resource utilization
- CDN cache hit rates

Alerts will be configured for critical thresholds, with different severity levels triggering appropriate notification channels (email, SMS, Slack) based on impact and urgency.

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Type | Information Captured | Storage | Retention |
|----------|----------------------|---------|-----------|
| Access Logs | Request details, response codes, timing | CloudWatch Logs | 30 days |
| Application Logs | Service operations, warnings, errors | CloudWatch Logs | 90 days |
| Error Logs | Detailed error information, stack traces | CloudWatch Logs | 90 days |
| Audit Logs | Security-relevant actions, admin activities | CloudWatch Logs | 1 year |

Our logging strategy implements structured logging with consistent formats across all components. Each log entry will include:
- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format
- Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG)
- Service/component identifier
- Correlation ID for request tracing
- Event description
- Contextual data (as JSON)

For distributed tracing, we'll implement correlation IDs that flow through all system components, allowing us to track requests across service boundaries. This will be particularly important for complex operations like file uploads that involve multiple services.

Log aggregation will centralize logs in CloudWatch Logs, with important events forwarded to a monitoring dashboard for visualization and alerting. Sensitive information will be redacted from logs according to data protection requirements.

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

```mermaid

    Error[Error Occurs] --> Classify{Classify Error}
    
    Classify -->|Validation Error| HandleValidation[Return Validation Details]
    Classify -->|Temporary System Error| HandleRetryable[Implement Retry with Backoff]
    Classify -->|Permanent System Error| HandlePermanent[Fail Gracefully]

    RetrySuccess -->|No| Fallback[Use Fallback Mechanism]
    
    HandlePermanent --> LogError[Log Detailed Error]
    LogError --> AlertOps[Alert Operations Team]
    LogError --> UserMessage[Display Friendly Error Message]
    
    HandleExternal --> CircuitState{Circuit State}
    CircuitState -->|Closed| AttemptCall[Attempt Service Call]
    CircuitState -->|Open| UseFallback[Use Fallback Response]
    CircuitState -->|Half-Open| LimitedAttempt[Limited Attempt]
    
    AttemptCall --> CallSuccess{Call Successful?}
    CallSuccess -->|Yes| ResetCircuit[Reset Circuit]
    CallSuccess -->|No| IncrementFailure[Increment Failure Count]
    
    LimitedAttempt --> ProbeSuccess{Probe Successful?}
    ProbeSuccess -->|Yes| CloseCircuit[Close Circuit]
    ProbeSuccess -->|No| OpenCircuit[Open Circuit]
```

Our error handling strategy follows these key principles:

1. **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early and return clear validation errors
2. **Fail Gracefully**: When errors occur, maintain system stability and provide clear user feedback
3. **Retry with Backoff**: For transient errors, implement exponential backoff retry strategies
4. **Circuit Breaking**: Prevent cascading failures when external services are unavailable
5. **Detailed Logging**: Log comprehensive error details for troubleshooting
6. **User-Friendly Messages**: Present clear, actionable error messages to users

For frontend components, we'll implement error boundaries to contain failures within specific UI components rather than crashing the entire application. Each form will have dedicated error handling to provide field-specific validation feedback.

Backend services will use structured error responses with consistent formats, including error codes, messages, and when appropriate, remediation suggestions. Sensitive error details will never be exposed to end users.

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The authentication and authorization framework will secure both user-facing and administrative functions while maintaining a seamless user experience. For the public website, most content will be publicly accessible without authentication, but certain actions will require varying levels of verification:

- **Form submissions**: CAPTCHA verification to prevent spam
- **File uploads**: Temporary session tokens to authorize upload operations
- **Admin functions**: Full authentication with role-based access control

For administrative access to the CMS and backend systems, we'll implement:

- **Identity Provider**: Auth0 for centralized identity management
- **Authentication Methods**: Username/password with MFA for administrators
- **Session Management**: Short-lived JWT tokens with refresh capability
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on user roles
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of authentication events and admin actions

API security will be implemented through:
- API keys for service-to-service communication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- CORS policies to control access from different origins

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Page Load Time | < 2 seconds | > 3 seconds | Real User Monitoring |
| Time to First Byte | < 200ms | > 500ms | Synthetic Testing |
| API Response Time | < 300ms (95th percentile) | > 1 second | APM |
| Availability | 99.9% | < 99.5% | Uptime Monitoring |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | > 1% | Application Logs |
| File Upload Success | > 99% | < 95% | Application Metrics |

Performance optimization will focus on:
- Static generation of content pages where possible
- CDN distribution of static assets
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and bundle optimization
- Efficient API design with appropriate caching
- Database query optimization

Load testing will be conducted to verify the system can handle expected traffic volumes with a safety margin of 3x typical peak load. Performance testing will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions before deployment.

#### 5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures

The disaster recovery strategy will ensure business continuity in the event of system failures or data loss. Key components include:

**Backup Procedures:**
- Content data: Daily exports from Contentful CMS
- User-uploaded files: Replicated across multiple AWS regions
- Configuration: Infrastructure as Code stored in version control
- Databases: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery

**Recovery Time Objectives (RTO):**
- Website frontend: < 1 hour
- Content API: < 2 hours
- Form submission capability: < 4 hours
- File upload capability: < 8 hours

**Recovery Point Objectives (RPO):**
- Content data: < 24 hours
- User uploads: < 1 hour
- Form submissions: Zero loss (direct to CRM)

**Disaster Scenarios Addressed:**
- Primary region failure: Failover to secondary region
- Data corruption: Restore from backups
- External service outage: Implement graceful degradation
- Security breach: Isolation and clean restoration

Regular disaster recovery testing will be conducted to verify procedures and train team members. Documentation will be maintained with clear, step-by-step recovery instructions for different failure scenarios.

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

The IndiVillage.com website will implement a modular service-oriented architecture to support its AI-as-a-service showcase, data upload capabilities, and social impact storytelling. While not a full microservices architecture, the system will be composed of distinct service components with clear boundaries and responsibilities.

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibility | Key Functions |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| Content Service | Manage and deliver website content | Content retrieval, caching, localization |
| Form Processing Service | Handle all form submissions | Validation, spam prevention, CRM integration |
| File Upload Service | Manage secure file uploads | File validation, storage, virus scanning |
| Data Analysis Service | Process uploaded datasets | Format detection, sample analysis, result generation |
| Notification Service | Manage all communications | Email notifications, status updates, alerts |

#### Inter-service Communication Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Use Cases |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Synchronous REST | HTTP/JSON API calls | Content retrieval, form submissions |
| Asynchronous Messaging | Message queue (AWS SQS) | File processing, email notifications |
| Event-driven | Event bus (AWS EventBridge) | Status updates, system events |
| Webhook | HTTP callbacks | CRM integration, build triggers |

```mermaid

    Client[Client Browser] --> API[API Gateway]
    
    API --> ContentService[Content Service]
    API --> FormService[Form Processing Service]
    API --> UploadService[File Upload Service]
    
    UploadService --> Queue[(Message Queue)]
    Queue --> AnalysisService[Data Analysis Service]
    
    FormService --> CRM[CRM Integration]
    AnalysisService --> NotificationService[Notification Service]

        API --> ContentService
        API --> FormService
        API --> UploadService
    end
    
    subgraph "Asynchronous Communication"
        UploadService --> Queue
        Queue --> AnalysisService
        AnalysisService --> NotificationService
        NotificationService --> EmailProvider
    end
```

#### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| API Gateway | AWS API Gateway | Route requests to appropriate services |
| Load Balancer | AWS Application Load Balancer | Distribute traffic across service instances |
| Service Registry | AWS CloudMap | Service discovery for internal services |
| DNS Management | AWS Route 53 | External service discovery and routing |

The system will use AWS API Gateway as the primary entry point for all client requests, which will route traffic to the appropriate service based on the request path and method. For internal service-to-service communication, AWS CloudMap will provide service discovery capabilities.

Load balancing will be implemented using AWS Application Load Balancer for services that require horizontal scaling, particularly the File Upload Service and Data Analysis Service which may experience variable load.

#### Circuit Breaker and Resilience Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Applied To |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Circuit Breaker | Resilience4j | External API calls, CRM integration |
| Bulkhead | Service isolation | File processing, data analysis |
| Rate Limiting | API Gateway | All public endpoints |
| Timeout | Configuration-based | All service calls |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Service as Service
    participant CircuitBreaker as Circuit Breaker
    participant ExternalAPI as External API
    
    Client->>API: Request
    API->>Service: Forward request

        ExternalAPI->>CircuitBreaker: Response
        CircuitBreaker->>Service: Forward response
    else Circuit Open
        CircuitBreaker->>Service: Return fallback
        Note over CircuitBreaker,Service: Previous failures exceeded threshold
    else Circuit Half-Open
        CircuitBreaker->>ExternalAPI: Test call
        ExternalAPI->>CircuitBreaker: Response
        CircuitBreaker->>CircuitBreaker: Reset if successful
    end
    
    Service->>API: Response
    API->>Client: Forward response
```

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Implementation | Configuration |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Retry | Exponential backoff | Max 3 retries with jitter |
| Fallback | Static content | Pre-generated fallback responses |
| Graceful Degradation | Feature toggles | Disable non-critical features |
| Timeout Management | Request cancellation | Cancel after 10s for user requests |

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

The IndiVillage.com website will implement a scalable architecture designed to handle variable traffic loads while maintaining performance and cost efficiency.

#### Horizontal/Vertical Scaling Approach

| Service | Scaling Approach | Justification |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Content Service | Horizontal + CDN | Read-heavy workload benefits from distribution |
| Form Processing | Horizontal | Needs to scale with traffic spikes |
| File Upload | Horizontal | Variable load based on user activity |
| Data Analysis | Horizontal + Vertical | CPU/memory intensive processing |
| Database | Vertical primary with read replicas | Write consistency with read scaling |

```mermaid

        Database
    end
    
    subgraph "Content Distribution"
        CDN
        StaticContent
    end
```

#### Auto-scaling Triggers and Rules

| Service | Scaling Metric | Scale-Out Trigger | Scale-In Trigger | Cooldown Period |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Web Servers | CPU Utilization | > 70% for 3 minutes | < 40% for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| API Servers | Request Count | > 1000 req/min for 2 minutes | < 500 req/min for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Upload Service | Queue Depth | > 50 messages for 2 minutes | < 10 messages for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Analysis Service | CPU Utilization | > 60% for 3 minutes | < 30% for 10 minutes | 10 minutes |

Auto-scaling will be implemented using AWS Auto Scaling Groups with the triggers defined above. For the Data Analysis Service, which processes uploaded files, we'll also implement predictive scaling based on historical patterns of upload activity to ensure capacity is available before peak periods.

#### Resource Allocation Strategy

| Resource Type | Allocation Strategy | Optimization Approach |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Compute | Right-sized instances | Match instance types to workload characteristics |
| Memory | Workload-based allocation | Higher memory for analysis services |
| Storage | Tiered approach | Hot/warm/cold storage based on access patterns |
| Network | Bandwidth optimization | CDN for content, compression for APIs |

The resource allocation strategy focuses on matching resources to workload characteristics while maintaining cost efficiency. For example, the Data Analysis Service will use compute-optimized instances, while the Content Service will use general-purpose instances with CDN offloading.

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Target Services |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Caching | Multi-level caching | Content Service, API responses |
| Connection Pooling | Database connections | All database-connected services |
| Asynchronous Processing | Message queues | File Upload, Data Analysis |
| Compression | gzip/Brotli | All HTTP responses |
| Database Optimization | Indexing, query optimization | All database operations |

### 6.1.3 RESILIENCE PATTERNS

The IndiVillage.com website will implement multiple resilience patterns to ensure high availability and fault tolerance, particularly for critical user-facing features.

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Implementation | Applied To |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Redundancy | Multiple service instances | All services |
| Isolation | Service boundaries | Critical path isolation |
| Health Checks | Active monitoring | All service instances |
| Graceful Degradation | Feature toggles | Non-critical features |

    end
```

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

| Recovery Type | Implementation | Recovery Time Objective | Recovery Point Objective |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Service Recovery | Auto-healing | < 5 minutes | No data loss |
| Region Failure | Multi-region deployment | < 30 minutes | < 5 minutes data loss |
| Data Corruption | Point-in-time recovery | < 1 hour | < 5 minutes data loss |
| Complete Outage | Full system restore | < 4 hours | < 15 minutes data loss |

The disaster recovery strategy includes regular backups, automated recovery procedures, and documented manual processes for scenarios that require human intervention. For critical data like user uploads and form submissions, we'll implement near-real-time replication to a secondary region.

#### Data Redundancy Approach

| Data Type | Redundancy Method | Consistency Model |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Content | Multi-region replication | Eventually consistent |
| User Uploads | Cross-region replication | Eventually consistent |
| Form Submissions | Synchronous replication | Strongly consistent |
| System Configuration | Version-controlled IaC | Deployment consistency |

| High Load | Disable non-critical features | Reduced functionality | Medium |
| Partial Outage | Serve static content | Limited interactivity | High |
| Database Issues | Read-only mode | No new submissions | Critical |
| External API Failure | Use cached responses | Potentially stale data | Medium |

The system will implement feature toggles to allow selective disabling of non-critical features during high load or partial outage scenarios. Critical user flows like form submissions and file uploads will be prioritized over less essential features like social media integration or real-time analytics.

#### Data Models and Structures

**Content Data Models**

| Entity | Description | Key Fields | Relationships |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Service | AI service offerings | id, name, slug, description, icon, order | CaseStudy, ServiceFeature |
| ServiceFeature | Features of services | id, service_id, title, description | Service |
| CaseStudy | Client success stories | id, title, slug, client, challenge, solution, industry_id | Service, Industry, CaseStudyResult |
| Industry | Client industry sectors | id, name, slug | CaseStudy |
| ImpactStory | Social impact narratives | id, title, slug, story, beneficiaries, location_id | Location, ImpactMetric |
| Location | Geographic locations | id, name, region, country | ImpactStory |
| ImpactMetric | Impact measurement data | id, story_id, metric_name, value, unit | ImpactStory |

**Operational Data Models**

| Entity | Description | Key Fields | Relationships |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| User | Website visitors | id, email, name, company, created_at | FileUpload, FormSubmission |
| FileUpload | Uploaded data samples | id, user_id, filename, size, mime_type, status, path | User, FileAnalysis |
| FileAnalysis | Analysis of uploads | id, upload_id, summary, details, created_at | FileUpload |
| FormSubmission | Form submissions | id, user_id, form_type_id, data, status, created_at | User, FormType, Service |
| FormType | Types of forms | id, name, description | FormSubmission |

#### Indexing Strategy

| Table | Index Type | Columns | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Service | Primary | id | Unique identifier |
| Service | Unique | slug | URL-friendly lookup |
| Service | Index | name | Search optimization |
| CaseStudy | Primary | id | Unique identifier |
| CaseStudy | Unique | slug | URL-friendly lookup |
| CaseStudy | Index | industry_id | Filter by industry |
| ImpactStory | Primary | id | Unique identifier |
| ImpactStory | Unique | slug | URL-friendly lookup |
| ImpactStory | Index | location_id | Filter by location |
| FileUpload | Primary | id | Unique identifier |
| FileUpload | Index | user_id | User's uploads |
| FileUpload | Index | status | Filter by status |
| FormSubmission | Primary | id | Unique identifier |
| FormSubmission | Index | user_id | User's submissions |
| FormSubmission | Index | form_type_id, created_at | Reporting queries |

#### Partitioning Approach

| Table | Partition Type | Partition Key | Retention |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| FileUpload | Time-based | created_at (monthly) | 12 months |
| FileAnalysis | Time-based | created_at (monthly) | 12 months |
| FormSubmission | Time-based | created_at (monthly) | 24 months |
| AuditLog | Time-based | timestamp (weekly) | 36 months |

The partitioning strategy focuses on operational tables with high growth rates. Content tables (Service, CaseStudy, ImpactStory) will not be partitioned due to their relatively small size and infrequent updates.

#### Replication Configuration

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Primary Region"
        PrimaryDB[(Primary Database)]
        PrimaryReadReplica1[(Read Replica 1)]
        PrimaryReadReplica2[(Read Replica 2)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Secondary Region"
        SecondaryDB[(Secondary Database)]
        SecondaryReadReplica[(Read Replica)]
    end
    
    PrimaryDB -->|Synchronous| PrimaryReadReplica1
    PrimaryDB -->|Synchronous| PrimaryReadReplica2
    PrimaryDB -->|Asynchronous| SecondaryDB
    SecondaryDB -->|Synchronous| SecondaryReadReplica
    
    Application1[Web Application] --> PrimaryReadReplica1
    Application1 -.->|Writes| PrimaryDB
    
    Application2[API Services] --> PrimaryReadReplica2
    Application2 -.->|Writes| PrimaryDB
    
    BackupService[Backup Service] --> SecondaryDB
```

| Replication Type | Configuration | Purpose |
|------------------|--------------|---------|
| Read Replicas | 2 in primary region | Handle read traffic, reporting queries |
| Cross-Region | 1 secondary database | Disaster recovery, geographic redundancy |
| Secondary Reads | 1 read replica in secondary | Regional performance, backup source |

#### Backup Architecture

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Storage |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Full Backup | Daily | 30 days | S3 Standard |
| Incremental Backup | Hourly | 7 days | S3 Standard |
| Transaction Logs | Continuous | 24 hours | S3 Standard |
| Snapshot | Weekly | 90 days | S3 Standard-IA |
| Archive Backup | Monthly | 7 years | S3 Glacier |

Point-in-time recovery will be enabled with a recovery window of 35 days. Backups will be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS keys and replicated across regions for disaster recovery purposes.

### 6.2.2 DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

| Migration Type | Tool | Approach | Validation |
|----------------|------|----------|------------|
| Schema Changes | Flyway | Version-controlled migrations | Automated tests |
| Data Imports | Custom ETL | Staged imports with validation | Data integrity checks |
| Content Migration | CMS Export/Import | Structured content mapping | Manual verification |
| Legacy Data | Custom Scripts | Transform and load | Sampling and validation |

The migration process will follow these steps:
1. Development of migration scripts in isolated environment
2. Validation against test dataset
3. Dry-run in staging environment
4. Execution in production with rollback plan
5. Post-migration validation

#### Versioning Strategy

| Component | Versioning Approach | Change Management |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Schema | Sequential version numbers | Database migration scripts |
| Content Structure | Semantic versioning | CMS content models |
| API Data Models | Semantic versioning | API version in URL path |
| Query Interfaces | Interface versioning | Backward compatibility |

Database schema changes will be managed through version-controlled migration scripts using Flyway. Each migration will be atomic and idempotent to ensure reliable deployments and rollbacks if necessary.

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archive Trigger | Archive Storage |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Form Submissions | 24 months | Age > 24 months | S3 Glacier |
| File Uploads | 12 months | Age > 12 months | S3 Glacier |
| File Analysis | 12 months | Age > 12 months | S3 Glacier |
| Audit Logs | 36 months | Age > 36 months | S3 Glacier Deep Archive |
| Content Revisions | All versions | Never (historical record) | Primary database |

Archived data will be stored in a queryable format (JSON) with sufficient metadata to enable retrieval if needed for compliance or business purposes. A metadata index will be maintained in the primary database to facilitate searches across archived data.

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

| Data Type | Storage Mechanism | Retrieval Pattern | Optimization |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Content | PostgreSQL | API-based, cached | Read replicas |
| User Uploads | S3 + Metadata in DB | Presigned URLs | CDN for frequent access |
| Form Data | PostgreSQL | API-based | Partitioning by date |
| Analysis Results | S3 + Summary in DB | API with pagination | Materialized views |
| Audit Data | PostgreSQL | Admin API with filters | Time-based partitioning |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client Application] --> API[API Gateway]
    
    subgraph "Data Access Layer"
        API --> ContentService[Content Service]
        API --> FormService[Form Service]
        API --> UploadService[Upload Service]
        API --> AnalyticsService[Analytics Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        ContentService --> ContentCache[(Redis Cache)]
        ContentCache --> ContentDB[(PostgreSQL - Content)]
        
        FormService --> FormDB[(PostgreSQL - Forms)]
        
        UploadService --> MetadataDB[(PostgreSQL - Metadata)]
        UploadService --> FileStorage[(S3 Storage)]
        
        AnalyticsService --> AnalyticsDB[(PostgreSQL - Analytics)]
        AnalyticsService --> DataWarehouse[(Data Warehouse)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Archive Layer"
        FormDB -.-> ArchiveProcess[Archive Process]
        MetadataDB -.-> ArchiveProcess
        AnalyticsDB -.-> ArchiveProcess
        
        ArchiveProcess --> ArchiveStorage[(S3 Glacier)]
    end
```

#### Caching Policies

| Cache Type | Implementation | Invalidation Strategy | TTL |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|-----|
| Content Cache | Redis | Event-based + TTL | 1 hour |
| API Response | Redis | Key-based + TTL | 5 minutes |
| Database Query | PostgreSQL | Transaction-based | N/A |
| File Metadata | Redis | Event-based | 15 minutes |
| User Session | Redis | Expiration + Logout | 24 hours |

Content caching will use a two-level approach with Redis for application-level caching and CDN for edge caching. Cache invalidation will be triggered by content updates through a publish-subscribe mechanism.

### 6.2.3 COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

#### Data Retention Rules

| Data Category | Retention Period | Justification | Disposal Method |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Personal Data | 24 months | Business need + consent | Secure deletion |
| Uploaded Files | 12 months | Service provision | Secure deletion |
| Usage Analytics | 36 months | Business intelligence | Anonymization |
| Audit Logs | 7 years | Compliance requirements | Secure archival |
| Content History | Indefinite | Business continuity | N/A |

Data retention policies will be enforced through automated processes that identify and process data based on retention rules. Users will be informed of these policies through the privacy policy, and consent will be obtained for personal data storage.

#### Backup and Fault Tolerance Policies

| Aspect | Policy | Implementation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| RPO (Recovery Point Objective) | < 15 minutes | Transaction log shipping |
| RTO (Recovery Time Objective) | < 1 hour | Automated recovery procedures |
| Backup Testing | Monthly | Restore to isolated environment |
| Fault Detection | Real-time | Automated monitoring and alerts |
| Failover | Automatic | Read replica promotion |

Backup verification will be performed monthly by restoring to an isolated environment and running integrity checks. Disaster recovery procedures will be tested quarterly through simulated failure scenarios.

#### Privacy Controls

| Control | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Data Minimization | Schema design | Collect only necessary data |
| Purpose Limitation | Business logic | Use data only for stated purposes |
| Storage Limitation | Retention policies | Delete data when no longer needed |
| Data Encryption | TDE + Field-level | Protect sensitive data |
| Anonymization | Data transformation | Analytics without personal data |

Personal data will be stored with appropriate security controls, including encryption at rest and in transit. Where possible, personal identifiers will be stored separately from associated data using tokenization.

#### Audit Mechanisms

| Audit Type | Scope | Storage | Retention |
|------------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Data Access | All personal data access | Audit tables | 7 years |
| Schema Changes | All DDL operations | Migration logs | Indefinite |
| Admin Actions | All privileged operations | Audit tables | 7 years |
| Authentication | Login attempts | Security logs | 1 year |
| Data Export | All data exports | Audit tables | 7 years |

Audit logs will capture the who, what, when, and where of all sensitive operations. Each audit record will include the user identifier, timestamp, operation type, affected data, and source IP address.

#### Access Controls

| Access Level | Permissions | Authentication | Authorization |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Public Read | Content data | None | Public endpoints |
| User | Own submissions | JWT token | Role-based access |
| Content Editor | Content management | MFA | Role-based access |
| Administrator | System configuration | MFA | Role-based access |
| Database Admin | Direct database access | MFA + VPN | Least privilege |

Database access will follow the principle of least privilege, with application access using dedicated service accounts with limited permissions. Direct database access will be restricted to authorized administrators through secure channels.

### 6.2.4 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Use Cases |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Covering Indexes | Composite indexes | Frequent filtering and sorting |
| Materialized Views | Scheduled refresh | Complex reporting queries |
| Denormalization | Calculated fields | Performance-critical lookups |
| Query Rewriting | ORM optimization | Complex joins and aggregations |
| Execution Plans | Regular analysis | Query performance monitoring |

Query optimization will be an ongoing process, with regular review of slow query logs and execution plans. Critical queries will have documented execution plans that are verified after schema changes.

#### Caching Strategy

| Cache Level | Implementation | Data Types | Invalidation |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Application | Redis | API responses, objects | TTL + explicit |
| Database | PgBouncer | Query results | Transaction-based |
| CDN | CloudFront | Static content, assets | Expiration + purge |
| Browser | HTTP headers | UI components, assets | Cache-Control |

The multi-level caching strategy will reduce database load and improve response times. Cache hit rates will be monitored, and cache warming will be implemented for critical content.

#### Connection Pooling

| Pool Type | Implementation | Pool Size | Timeout |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Web Tier | PgBouncer | 20-50 connections | 30 seconds |
| API Tier | PgBouncer | 50-100 connections | 60 seconds |
| Admin Tier | PgBouncer | 5-10 connections | 300 seconds |
| Batch Processing | Direct | 5-10 connections | 600 seconds |

Connection pooling will be implemented using PgBouncer in transaction pooling mode. Pool sizes will be tuned based on workload characteristics and server capacity.

#### Read/Write Splitting

| Operation Type | Database Target | Implementation |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Content Reads | Read replicas | Service configuration |
| Form Submissions | Primary database | Direct routing |
| File Metadata Reads | Read replicas | Service configuration |
| Analytics Queries | Read replicas | Query routing |
| Admin Operations | Primary database | Role-based routing |

Read/write splitting will direct read-heavy operations to replicas while ensuring all writes go to the primary database. The application will be aware of replication lag and can route critical reads to the primary when necessary.

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Process | Frequency | Implementation | Optimization |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Data Archiving | Daily | Background jobs | Off-peak scheduling |
| Analytics ETL | Hourly | AWS Glue | Incremental processing |
| Report Generation | Daily | Scheduled jobs | Materialized views |
| Index Maintenance | Weekly | Maintenance window | Concurrent operations |
| Data Validation | Daily | Background jobs | Sampling for large tables |

Batch processes will be scheduled during off-peak hours and designed to be resumable in case of interruption. Resource-intensive operations will be throttled to minimize impact on user-facing services.

### 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

#### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

The IndiVillage.com website will implement a comprehensive API architecture to support its AI-as-a-service offerings, data upload capabilities, and integration with external systems.

**Protocol Specifications**

| Protocol | Usage | Endpoints | Security |
|----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| REST over HTTPS | Primary API protocol | Customer-facing services, CMS integration | TLS 1.2+, CORS policies |
| GraphQL | Content delivery | Content queries, filtering | TLS 1.2+, query complexity limits |
| WebSockets | Real-time updates | Upload status, processing notifications | TLS 1.2+, token authentication |

**Authentication Methods**

| Method | Use Case | Implementation | Token Lifetime |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| JWT | API authentication | Bearer token in Authorization header | 1 hour access, 24 hour refresh |
| API Keys | Third-party integrations | Custom header (X-API-Key) | Long-lived with rotation |
| OAuth 2.0 | CRM integration | Authorization code flow | Based on provider settings |
| Temporary Tokens | File uploads | Signed URL with embedded token | 15 minutes |

**Authorization Framework**

```mermaid

    Request[API Request] --> Authentication[Authentication Layer]
    Authentication -->|Valid Credentials| TokenValidation[Token Validation]
    Authentication -->|Invalid Credentials| Reject[401 Unauthorized]
    
    TokenValidation -->|Valid Token| RoleCheck[Role/Permission Check]
    TokenValidation -->|Invalid Token| Reject2[401 Unauthorized]
    
    RoleCheck -->|Has Permission| RateLimit[Rate Limiting Check]

    RateLimit -->|Within Limits| ResourceAccess[Resource Access]
    RateLimit -->|Exceeded Limits| Reject4[429 Too Many Requests]
    
    ResourceAccess --> Response[API Response]
```

**Rate Limiting Strategy**

| API Category | Rate Limit | Window | Burst Allowance |
|--------------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Public APIs | 60 requests | 1 minute | 10 additional requests |
| Authenticated APIs | 300 requests | 1 minute | 50 additional requests |
| Upload APIs | 10 uploads | 1 minute | 5 additional uploads |
| Admin APIs | 600 requests | 1 minute | 100 additional requests |

**Versioning Approach**

| Aspect | Strategy | Implementation | Example |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------|
| URL Path | Major version in path | /api/v1/resource | /api/v1/services |
| Headers | Minor version in header | X-API-Version: 1.2 | For backward compatibility |
| Content Type | Version in Accept header | Accept: application/vnd.indivillage.v1+json | For specialized clients |
| Deprecation | Grace period | Deprecation: true, Sunset: date | With migration documentation |

**Documentation Standards**

| Standard | Tool | Output | Audience |
|----------|------|--------|----------|
| OpenAPI 3.0 | Swagger | Interactive documentation | Developers, integrators |
| API Blueprint | Apiary | Developer portal | External partners |

## 6.5 MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY

### 6.5.1 MONITORING INFRASTRUCTURE

The IndiVillage.com website will implement a comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and user experience. This strategy will provide real-time visibility into system health, performance bottlenecks, and business metrics.

#### Metrics Collection

| Component | Collection Method | Metrics Type | Retention |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Frontend | Real User Monitoring (RUM) | Performance, errors, user journeys | 90 days |
| API Services | Application instrumentation | Throughput, latency, error rates | 90 days |
| Infrastructure | Agent-based collection | Resource utilization, availability | 90 days |
| Business Events | Custom event tracking | Conversions, engagement, uploads | 13 months |

The metrics collection architecture will use AWS CloudWatch as the primary metrics repository, with custom metrics pushed from application components. Frontend performance will be tracked using both synthetic monitoring and real user monitoring to provide a complete picture of the user experience.

#### Log Aggregation

| Log Source | Log Types | Aggregation Method | Retention |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Web Servers | Access logs, error logs | CloudWatch Logs | 30 days |
| API Services | Application logs, audit logs | CloudWatch Logs | 90 days |
| Database | Query logs, error logs | CloudWatch Logs | 14 days |
| Security | Authentication, authorization | CloudWatch Logs | 1 year |

Logs will be structured in JSON format with consistent fields including timestamp, service name, log level, correlation ID, and message. Sensitive information will be automatically redacted before storage. Log aggregation will enable centralized searching, filtering, and analysis across all system components.

#### Distributed Tracing

| Tracing Aspect | Implementation | Coverage | Sampling Rate |
|----------------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Request Tracing | AWS X-Ray | All API requests | 5% baseline, 100% for errors |
| User Journeys | Custom trace IDs | Critical user flows | 10% of sessions |
| File Processing | Event correlation | All file uploads | 100% |
| External Services | Service annotations | CRM, email, storage | 5% baseline, 100% for errors |

Distributed tracing will be implemented using correlation IDs that flow through all system components, allowing end-to-end visibility of request processing. This will be particularly valuable for complex operations like file uploads that involve multiple services and asynchronous processing.

        Dashboard -->|All| OperationsTeam[Operations Team]
    end
```

#### Dashboard Design

The monitoring dashboard architecture will follow a hierarchical approach with different levels of detail for different stakeholders:

1. **Executive Dashboard**: High-level business metrics, SLA compliance, and system health
2. **Operations Dashboard**: System performance, resource utilization, and alert status
3. **Development Dashboard**: Detailed component metrics, error rates, and deployment status
4. **Security Dashboard**: Authentication events, suspicious activities, and compliance status

Each dashboard will be designed with specific user personas in mind, providing the right level of information for decision-making without overwhelming the user.

```

### 6.5.2 OBSERVABILITY PATTERNS

#### Health Checks

| Component | Health Check Type | Frequency | Failure Threshold |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Web Servers | HTTP endpoint check | 30 seconds | 3 consecutive failures |
| API Services | Synthetic transaction | 1 minute | 2 consecutive failures |
| Database | Connection test | 1 minute | 2 consecutive failures |
| External Services | API ping | 5 minutes | 3 consecutive failures |

Health checks will be implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Basic Availability**: Simple endpoint checks to verify service responsiveness
2. **Functional Verification**: Synthetic transactions that exercise key functionality
3. **Dependency Checks**: Verification of critical dependencies like databases and external services
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user journey simulations for critical paths

#### Performance Metrics

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Baseline | Alert Threshold |
|-----------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Frontend | First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive, Cumulative Layout Shift | FCP < 1.5s, TTI < 3.5s, CLS < 0.1 | FCP > 2.5s, TTI > 5s, CLS > 0.25 |
| API Services | Response time, throughput, error rate | 95th percentile < 300ms, Error rate < 0.1% | 95th percentile > 1s, Error rate > 1% |
| Database | Query time, connection utilization, cache hit ratio | 95th percentile < 100ms, Connections < 70%, Cache hits > 80% | 95th percentile > 500ms, Connections > 90%, Cache hits < 60% |
| File Processing | Processing time, queue depth, success rate | 95th percentile < 30s, Queue depth < 50, Success rate > 99% | 95th percentile > 2min, Queue depth > 200, Success rate < 95% |

Performance metrics will be collected at regular intervals and analyzed for trends. Baselines will be established during initial operation and refined over time to account for growth and seasonal patterns.

#### Business Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Visualization | Business Impact |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Demo Request Rate | Number of demo requests per day | Time series with trend line | Lead generation effectiveness |
| Quote Request Rate | Number of quote requests per day | Time series with trend line | Sales pipeline health |

| Conversion Rate | Percentage of visitors who submit forms | Funnel visualization | Marketing effectiveness |
| Service Interest | Distribution of interest across services | Pie chart with trend comparison | Product strategy insights |
| Social Impact Engagement | Time spent on impact stories | Heat map by story | Mission alignment measurement |

Business metrics will be integrated with performance and technical metrics to provide context for system behavior. For example, a spike in demo requests might explain increased API load, or a drop in conversions might correlate with performance degradation.

#### SLA Monitoring

| Service Level | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Frequency |
|---------------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Website Availability | 99.9% | Synthetic monitoring from multiple regions | Daily, Monthly |
| API Availability | 99.95% | Endpoint health checks | Daily, Monthly |
| Page Load Performance | 90% of pages load in < 3 seconds | Real User Monitoring | Weekly, Monthly |
| Form Submission Success | 99.5% success rate | Application logs | Daily, Monthly |
| File Upload Success | 98% success rate | Application logs | Daily, Monthly |
| Email Delivery | 99% delivery within 5 minutes | Delivery tracking | Weekly, Monthly |

SLA compliance will be tracked through dedicated dashboards with historical trends and incident annotations. Monthly SLA reports will be generated automatically for stakeholder review.

#### Capacity Tracking

| Resource | Metrics | Growth Indicators | Scaling Trigger |
|----------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Web Servers | CPU, memory, request rate | Sustained CPU > 60% | CPU > 70% for 5 minutes |
| API Servers | Request rate, response time | Sustained request rate increase | Response time > 500ms for 5 minutes |
| Database | Query volume, storage utilization | Storage growth rate | Storage > 80% utilized |
| File Storage | Storage utilization, upload rate | Storage growth rate | Storage > 70% utilized |
| Queue Services | Queue depth, processing time | Sustained queue depth | Queue depth > 100 for 10 minutes |

Capacity metrics will be used for both reactive scaling and proactive capacity planning. Historical trends will inform infrastructure sizing decisions and budget forecasting.

```

#### Escalation Procedures

| Severity | Initial Response | Escalation Trigger | Secondary Escalation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Critical | On-call engineer (15 min) | No acknowledgment in 15 min or no resolution in 1 hour | Engineering manager, then CTO |
| High | On-call engineer (30 min) | No acknowledgment in 30 min or no resolution in 2 hours | Engineering manager |
| Medium | Support team (4 hours) | No resolution in 8 hours | On-call engineer |
| Low | Development team (next business day) | No resolution in 3 business days | Support team |

The escalation process includes automated escalation paths for unacknowledged alerts and manual escalation options for complex incidents requiring additional expertise.

#### Runbooks

| Incident Type | Runbook Content | Automation Level | Maintenance Frequency |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Website Unavailability | Diagnostic steps, recovery procedures, communication templates | Semi-automated diagnostics | Quarterly review |
| API Performance Degradation | Performance analysis, scaling procedures, caching optimization | Automated scaling, manual optimization | Quarterly review |
| Database Issues | Connection troubleshooting, query analysis, recovery procedures | Automated diagnostics, manual recovery | Quarterly review |
| File Upload Failures | Storage verification, processing service checks, security scan status | Automated diagnostics | Quarterly review |
| External Service Outages | Dependency verification, fallback procedures, vendor communication | Manual with guided steps | Quarterly review |

Runbooks will be maintained in a centralized knowledge base with version control. Each runbook will include:
- Initial assessment steps
- Diagnostic procedures
- Resolution actions
- Verification methods
- Communication templates
- Escalation paths

#### Post-Mortem Processes

The post-mortem process follows a blameless approach focused on system improvement rather than individual fault. Each major incident will trigger a post-mortem meeting with the following structure:

1. **Incident Timeline**: Chronological review of events
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigation of underlying causes
3. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of user and business impact
4. **Response Effectiveness**: Review of detection, response, and resolution
5. **Action Items**: Specific improvements to prevent recurrence
6. **Lessons Learned**: Broader insights for system improvement

Post-mortem documents will be stored in a searchable repository to build organizational knowledge and identify patterns across incidents.

#### Improvement Tracking

| Improvement Category | Tracking Method | Review Frequency | Success Metrics |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| System Reliability | Action items from post-mortems | Monthly | Reduced incident frequency |
| Alert Effectiveness | Alert signal-to-noise ratio | Bi-weekly | Reduced false positives |
| Response Time | Time to acknowledge and resolve | Monthly | Decreased MTTR |
| Runbook Effectiveness | Resolution success rate | Quarterly | Higher first-time resolution |
| Monitoring Coverage | Gap analysis | Quarterly | Reduced undetected issues |

Improvement initiatives will be tracked in the team's project management system with clear ownership and deadlines. Regular reviews will assess progress and adjust priorities based on emerging patterns.

## 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

#### Unit Testing

| Aspect | Details | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Frameworks & Tools | Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library<br>Backend: pytest, unittest | Jest configured with React-specific matchers<br>pytest with coverage plugins |
| Test Organization | Frontend: Tests co-located with components<br>Backend: Tests in parallel directory structure | `Component.tsx` paired with `Component.test.tsx`<br>Python modules in `tests/unit/module_name/` |
| Mocking Strategy | Frontend: Mock service layer, not implementation<br>Backend: Mock external dependencies and services | React: jest.mock for services<br>Python: unittest.mock, pytest-mock |
| Code Coverage | 80% overall coverage<br>90% for critical paths<br>100% for utility functions | Jest coverage reports<br>pytest-cov for backend coverage |

The unit testing approach will focus on testing individual components in isolation. For React components, we'll test rendering, user interactions, and state changes. For backend services, we'll test business logic, data transformations, and error handling.

**Test Naming Conventions:**

```
Frontend: describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly with props', () => {...})
  it('should handle user interaction', () => {...})
})

Backend: def test_function_name_expected_behavior_when_condition():
```

**Test Data Management:**

Test data will be managed through:
- Static fixtures for common test cases
- Factory functions for generating test data with variations
- In-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- Environment-specific test data for integration tests

#### Integration Testing

| Aspect | Details | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Service Integration | Test service boundaries and interactions | API Gateway + Lambda integration tests |
| API Testing | Verify API contracts and responses | Supertest for REST APIs, Apollo Client for GraphQL |
| Database Integration | Test data persistence and retrieval | Test against in-memory or containerized databases |
| External Service Mocking | Simulate third-party service behavior | Wiremock for HTTP services, localstack for AWS services |
| Environment Management | Isolated environments for integration tests | Docker Compose for local testing, dedicated AWS accounts for CI |

Integration tests will focus on verifying that components work together correctly. This includes testing:
- API endpoints with actual database interactions
- Form submission flows from frontend to backend
- File upload and processing pipelines
- CRM integration with proper data mapping

**API Testing Strategy:**

API tests will verify:
1. Correct response status codes
2. Response payload structure and content
3. Error handling and validation
4. Authentication and authorization
5. Rate limiting and throttling behavior

#### End-to-End Testing

| Aspect | Details | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| E2E Test Scenarios | Critical user journeys and business flows | Cypress for browser testing, Playwright for cross-browser |
| UI Automation | Page object model for UI interaction | Cypress custom commands, Playwright fixtures |
| Test Data Setup | Seeded test data before test execution | Database seeding scripts, API-based setup |
| Performance Testing | Load, stress, and endurance testing | k6 for API load testing, Lighthouse for frontend performance |
| Cross-browser Testing | Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge | Playwright for cross-browser automation, BrowserStack for extended coverage |

**Key E2E Test Scenarios:**

1. Complete demo request journey
2. File upload and processing flow
3. Service exploration and information gathering
4. Social impact story navigation
5. Mobile responsive behavior verification

**Performance Testing Requirements:**

- Load testing: Simulate 100 concurrent users with normal usage patterns
- Stress testing: Ramp up to 500 concurrent users to identify breaking points
- Endurance testing: Maintain moderate load (50 users) for 24 hours
- Frontend performance: Core Web Vitals within "Good" thresholds

### 6.6.2 TEST AUTOMATION

| Aspect | Details | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| CI/CD Integration | Automated testing in deployment pipeline | GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline |
| Test Triggers | On pull request, scheduled, and manual triggers | PR checks, nightly runs, deployment gates |
| Parallel Execution | Run tests in parallel to reduce execution time | Jest workers, pytest-xdist, Cypress parallelization |
| Test Reporting | Consolidated test results and trends | JUnit XML output, GitHub Actions reports, custom dashboards |

**Automated Test Flow:**

    PerformanceTests --> QualityGate{Quality Gate}
    QualityGate -->|Pass| Approve[Ready for Review]
    QualityGate -->|Fail| Reject[Fix Required]
```

**Failed Test Handling:**

1. Immediate notification to PR author and team
2. Detailed failure logs with context and screenshots
3. Automatic retry for potentially flaky tests (max 2 retries)
4. Test failure categorization (functional, environmental, flaky)
5. Blocking PR merges for critical test failures

**Flaky Test Management:**

| Strategy | Implementation | Monitoring |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Identification | Track test success rate over time | Dashboard showing flakiest tests |
| Quarantine | Move flaky tests to separate suite | Non-blocking execution |
| Remediation | Prioritize fixing most impactful flaky tests | Weekly review of quarantined tests |
| Prevention | Code reviews for test stability | Test stability guidelines |

1. Business impact of failure
2. Technical complexity
3. Frequency of changes
4. User visibility

Critical features like file upload and processing will receive comprehensive testing across all test types, while lower-risk features may have more focused testing strategies.
