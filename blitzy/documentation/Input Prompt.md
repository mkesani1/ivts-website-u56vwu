I would like to build a stunning new, modern and up to date website for IndiVillage.com.  The website should show off our ai-as-a service and scalable back office capabilities.  The ai-as-a service includes data collection, data preparation (including annotation and labelling), AI model development and Human-in-the loop models.  The website should have the ability for customers to upload sample data sets and request a demo or quote.  Please also draw from IndiVillageFoundation.com to tell our social impact story...AI for Good.
