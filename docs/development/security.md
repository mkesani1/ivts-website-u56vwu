## Authentication and Authorization

The IndiVillage.com application implements a robust authentication and authorization framework to protect user accounts and control access to resources.

### JWT Authentication

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication with the following implementation details:

- **Token Types**: Access tokens and refresh tokens
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire after 60 minutes, refresh tokens after 24 hours
- **Token Storage**: Access tokens stored in memory, refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies
- **Token Signing**: RS256 algorithm with 2048-bit RSA keys
- **Token Validation**: Signature verification, expiration check, audience validation
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic refresh using refresh tokens
- **Token Revocation**: Blacklist mechanism for revoked tokens

```python
# Example JWT token creation
from app.security.jwt import create_access_token

user_data = {"sub": user_id, "role": user_role}
token = create_access_token(data=user_data)
```

### Password Policies

The following password policies are enforced:

- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Complexity requirements: Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Password history: No reuse of last 10 passwords
- Maximum age: 90 days for administrative accounts
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout
- Secure storage: Argon2id with unique salt

```python
# Example password hashing
from app.security.password import hash_password, verify_password

hashed_password = hash_password(plain_password)
is_valid = verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password)
```

### Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for administrative accounts:

- Required for all administrative access
- Supported methods: Authenticator app (TOTP), SMS
- Backup codes provided for recovery
- Session validation with MFA status
- MFA enrollment and management workflows

### Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict access to resources:

- **Roles**: Anonymous, User, Editor, Administrator
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained permissions for different operations
- **Resource Access**: Access control at the resource level
- **Permission Checks**: Enforced at API and service layers
- **Role Assignment**: Managed by administrators

```python
# Example permission check
from app.security.authorization import require_permission

@app.get("/admin/users")
@require_permission("user:read")
def get_users():
    # Only accessible to users with user:read permission
    pass
```

### Session Management

Secure session management is implemented with the following features:

- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
- Absolute session limit: 8 hours
- Secure session storage: Server-side with client token
- Session termination: Explicit logout and timeout
- Concurrent session control: Limit based on user role
- Session fixation protection: New session ID on authentication

## Data Protection

The IndiVillage.com application implements comprehensive data protection measures to safeguard sensitive information.

### Encryption Standards

The following encryption standards are implemented:

- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites
- **Sensitive Fields**: Field-level encryption for PII
- **Backups**: Encrypted backups with separate keys
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS for key management

```python
# Example field encryption
from app.security.encryption import encrypt_field, decrypt_field

encrypted_data = encrypt_field(sensitive_data, field_key)
decrypted_data = decrypt_field(encrypted_data, field_key)
```

### Key Management

Secure key management practices are implemented:

- **Key Hierarchy**: Master keys and data keys
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of cryptographic keys
- **Key Access Control**: Strict access controls for keys
- **Key Backup**: Secure backup of cryptographic keys
- **Key Generation**: Secure random key generation
- **Key Storage**: Secure storage in AWS KMS

### Data Classification

Data is classified according to sensitivity:

- **Public**: Information that can be freely disclosed
- **Internal**: Information for internal use only
- **Confidential**: Sensitive information requiring protection
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

Each classification has specific handling requirements and protection measures.

### Data Minimization

Data minimization principles are applied:

- Collect only necessary data
- Limit data retention periods
- Anonymize data where possible
- Implement data purging mechanisms
- Document data flows and storage locations

### Privacy Controls

Privacy controls are implemented to protect user data:

- Consent management for data collection
- Privacy policy and terms of service
- Data subject access request handling
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Data portability support
- Privacy impact assessments

## Input Validation and Output Encoding

Proper input validation and output encoding are critical for preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity.

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated using the following approaches:

- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic models for API requests
- **Type Validation**: Strong typing with TypeScript and Python type hints
- **Format Validation**: Regular expressions for specific formats
- **Range Validation**: Minimum and maximum values for numeric inputs
- **Whitelist Validation**: Allow only known good inputs

```python
# Example input validation with Pydantic
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, constr

class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    name: constr(min_length=2, max_length=100)
    email: EmailStr
    password: constr(min_length=12)
```

```typescript
// Example frontend validation
import { z } from 'zod';

const contactSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2).max(100),
  email: z.string().email(),
  message: z.string().min(10).max(1000)
});

type ContactForm = z.infer<typeof contactSchema>;
```

### Output Encoding

Output encoding is applied to prevent XSS and injection attacks:

- **HTML Encoding**: Escape HTML special characters
- **JavaScript Encoding**: Escape JavaScript special characters
- **URL Encoding**: Encode URL parameters
- **CSS Encoding**: Escape CSS special characters
- **JSON Encoding**: Proper JSON serialization

```python
# Example HTML encoding
from html import escape

def render_user_content(content):
    return escape(content)
```

```typescript
// React automatically escapes content
function UserContent({ content }: { content: string }) {
  return <div>{content}</div>; // Safe, React escapes this
}
```

### File Upload Validation

File uploads are validated to prevent security vulnerabilities:

- **File Type Validation**: Check MIME type and file extension
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum file size of 50MB
- **Malware Scanning**: Scan all uploads for malware
- **Storage Location**: Store in secure, isolated storage
- **File Processing**: Process files in a secure environment
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to uploaded files

```python
# Example file validation
from app.security.file_scanner import FileScanner
from app.security.input_validation import validate_file_extension, validate_file_size

def process_upload(file):
    # Validate file extension and size
    if not validate_file_extension(file.filename):
        raise ValueError("Invalid file type")
    
    if not validate_file_size(file.size):
        raise ValueError("File too large")
    
    # Scan for malware
    scanner = FileScanner()
    scan_result = scanner.scan_file(file.path)
    
    if not scan_result.is_clean():
        raise SecurityError("File contains malware")
    
    # Process the file
    # ...
```

### CAPTCHA Implementation

CAPTCHA verification is implemented to prevent automated attacks:

- **reCAPTCHA v3**: Invisible CAPTCHA for most users
- **reCAPTCHA v2**: Fallback for suspicious activity
- **Implementation Points**: Form submissions, login attempts, file uploads
- **Score Threshold**: 0.5 for normal operations
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Present CAPTCHA challenge for low scores

```python
# Example CAPTCHA verification
from app.security.captcha import validate_captcha_token

def process_form(data, captcha_token, remote_ip):
    # Verify CAPTCHA token
    if not validate_captcha_token(captcha_token, remote_ip):
        raise SecurityError("CAPTCHA verification failed")
    
    # Process form data
    # ...
```

```typescript
// Frontend CAPTCHA implementation
import { useRecaptcha } from '../hooks/useRecaptcha';

function ContactForm() {
  const { executeRecaptcha } = useRecaptcha();
  
  const handleSubmit = async (data) => {
    const token = await executeRecaptcha('contact_form');
    
    await api.submitForm({
      ...data,
      captchaToken: token
    });
  };
  
  // Form implementation
}
```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

CSRF protection is implemented to prevent unauthorized actions:

- **Token-based Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Same-Site Cookies**: SameSite=Lax for cookies
- **Custom Headers**: Custom headers for AJAX requests
- **Referrer Validation**: Check Referer header for sensitive operations

```python
# Example CSRF protection
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from app.security.csrf import validate_csrf_token

def csrf_protection(csrf_token: str):
    if not validate_csrf_token(csrf_token):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid CSRF token"
        )
    return True

@app.post("/api/update-profile")
def update_profile(data: dict, csrf_check = Depends(csrf_protection)):
    # Process profile update
    pass
```

## API Security

The IndiVillage.com API implements comprehensive security measures to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Authentication and Authorization

API authentication and authorization are implemented using:

- **JWT Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization header
- **API Keys**: For service-to-service communication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Permissions for API endpoints
- **Scoped Access**: Limit access to specific resources

```python
# Example API authentication
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from app.security.jwt import JWTHandler

jwt_handler = JWTHandler()

def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    try:
        payload = jwt_handler.validate_access_token(token)
        user_id = jwt_handler.get_user_id_from_token(payload)
        # Get user from database
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
        )
    return user

@app.get("/api/protected")
def protected_endpoint(current_user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Only accessible to authenticated users
    return {"message": "This is a protected endpoint"}
```

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage:

- **IP-based Limiting**: Limit requests by IP address
- **User-based Limiting**: Limit requests by authenticated user
- **Endpoint-specific Limits**: Different limits for different endpoints
- **Sliding Window Algorithm**: Time-based rate limiting
- **Response Headers**: Include rate limit information in responses

```python
# Example rate limiting
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, Request, status
from app.security.rate_limiting import RateLimiter

rate_limiter = RateLimiter()

def rate_limit(request: Request):
    client_ip = request.client.host
    endpoint = request.url.path
    
    is_allowed, remaining, reset_time = rate_limiter.limit_by_ip(
        ip_address=client_ip,
        endpoint=endpoint,
        limit=100,  # 100 requests
        window_seconds=3600  # per hour
    )
    
    if not is_allowed:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_429_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS,
            detail="Rate limit exceeded"
        )
    
    # Set rate limit headers
    headers = rate_limiter.get_headers(100, remaining, reset_time)
    request.state.rate_limit_headers = headers
    
    return True

@app.get("/api/public", dependencies=[Depends(rate_limit)])
def public_endpoint():
    # Rate-limited endpoint
    return {"message": "This is a public endpoint"}
```

### Request Validation

API requests are validated to ensure data integrity and prevent attacks:

- **Schema Validation**: Validate request structure and data types
- **Content Validation**: Validate request content
- **Size Limits**: Maximum request size
- **Content Type Validation**: Validate Content-Type header
- **Request Timeout**: Maximum request processing time

```python
# Example request validation with Pydantic
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, status
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, validator

router = APIRouter()

class ContactRequest(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr
    message: str
    
    @validator('name')
    def name_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 2 or len(v) > 100:
            raise ValueError('Name must be between 2 and 100 characters')
        return v
    
    @validator('message')
    def message_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 10 or len(v) > 1000:
            raise ValueError('Message must be between 10 and 1000 characters')
        return v

@router.post("/contact")
async def contact(request: ContactRequest):
    # Process contact request
    # ...
    return {"status": "success"}
```

### Response Security

API responses are secured to prevent information leakage:

- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers for all responses
- **Secure Headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages for production
- **Data Minimization**: Return only necessary data
- **Response Validation**: Validate response structure and content

```python
# Example secure response headers
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.middlewares.security_middleware import setup_security_middleware

app = FastAPI()

# Add security middleware to add secure headers to all responses
setup_security_middleware(app)
```

### API Documentation Security

API documentation is secured to prevent information leakage:

- **Authentication**: Require authentication for detailed documentation
- **Environment-specific Documentation**: Different detail levels for different environments
- **Sensitive Information**: Exclude sensitive information from documentation
- **Example Data**: Use fictional data in examples
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to documentation based on role

## Security Headers and Content Security Policy

Security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) are implemented to protect against various attacks.

### Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff`
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY`
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block`
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restrict powerful features
- **Cache-Control**: `no-store, max-age=0` for sensitive pages

```python
# Example security headers implementation
from app.security.headers import get_security_headers

def add_security_headers(response):
    headers = get_security_headers()
    for key, value in headers.items():
        response.headers[key] = value
    return response
```

### Content Security Policy

A strict Content Security Policy is implemented to prevent XSS and other injection attacks:

```
Content-Security-Policy: 
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://www.gstatic.com/recaptcha/;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https://www.google.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  connect-src 'self';
  frame-src 'self' https://www.google.com/recaptcha/;
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self';
```

The CSP is configured to allow only necessary sources and restrict potentially dangerous features.

### Subresource Integrity

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is implemented for external scripts and stylesheets:

```html
<script src="https://example.com/script.js"
        integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

SRI ensures that resources loaded from external sources have not been tampered with.

### Feature Policy

Feature Policy is implemented to restrict potentially dangerous browser features:

```
Permissions-Policy: 
  geolocation=(),
  microphone=(),
  camera=(),
  payment=(),
  usb=(),
  accelerometer=(),
  gyroscope=(),
  magnetometer=(),
  midi=(),
  sync-xhr=(self)
```

This policy restricts access to sensitive browser features that are not needed by the application.

## Secure Configuration and Deployment

Secure configuration and deployment practices are essential for maintaining the security of the application in production.

### Environment Configuration

Secure environment configuration practices are implemented:

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration
- **Secrets Management**: Use AWS Secrets Manager for secrets

- **Environment Separation**: Different configurations for different environments

```python
# Example configuration validation
from pydantic import BaseSettings, validator

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    SECRET_KEY: str
    DATABASE_URL: str
    REDIS_URL: str
    ENVIRONMENT: str = "development"
    
    @validator("SECRET_KEY")
    def secret_key_must_be_strong(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 32:
            raise ValueError("SECRET_KEY must be at least 32 characters")
        return v
    
    class Config:
