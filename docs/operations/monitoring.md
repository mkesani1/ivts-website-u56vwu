## Introduction

This document outlines the monitoring and observability strategy for IndiVillage.com, including objectives, scope, and architecture.

### Purpose

Comprehensive monitoring is critical for ensuring system reliability, performance, and user satisfaction. It enables proactive identification and resolution of issues, optimization of resource utilization, and informed decision-making based on real-time data.

### Scope

The monitoring system covers the following components:

- **Frontend**: Website performance, user experience, and error rates.
- **Backend**: API performance, service health, and database operations.
- **Infrastructure**: System resources (CPU, memory, disk), network traffic, and storage utilization.
- **Business Metrics**: Conversions, form submissions, file uploads, and user engagement.

### Monitoring Architecture

The monitoring architecture consists of the following components:

- **Data Sources**: Frontend applications, backend services, databases, infrastructure components, and external services.
- **Collection Layer**: Real User Monitoring (RUM), Application Performance Monitoring (APM), node_exporter, blackbox_exporter, and custom exporters.
- **Storage Layer**: Prometheus for metrics storage and long-term storage solutions.
- **Processing Layer**: Alert rules and recording rules for data aggregation and analysis.
- **Notification Layer**: Alertmanager for alert routing and notification via PagerDuty, Slack, and email.
- **Visualization Layer**: Grafana for creating dashboards and reports.

## Monitoring Infrastructure

Detailed explanation of the monitoring infrastructure components and their configuration.

### Prometheus

Prometheus <!-- 2.40.0 --> is used for metrics collection and storage. It is configured to scrape metrics from various exporters and services.

- **Configuration**: The Prometheus configuration is defined in `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus.yml` and includes scrape targets, alerting rules, and storage settings.
- **Scrape Targets**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from node_exporter, blackbox_exporter, and custom exporters.
- **Alerting Rules**: Alerting rules are defined in `infrastructure/monitoring/alerting-rules.yml` and are used to trigger alerts based on metric thresholds.

### Grafana

Grafana <!-- 9.3.0 --> is used for visualization and dashboarding. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing dashboards.

- **Dashboards**: Grafana dashboards are used to visualize metrics and monitor system performance.
- **Configuration**: Grafana is configured with Prometheus as a data source.
- **Web Dashboard**: The web dashboard monitors frontend performance and user experience.
- **API Dashboard**: The API dashboard monitors backend services and endpoints.
- **Infrastructure Dashboard**: The infrastructure dashboard monitors system resources and health.

### Alertmanager

Alertmanager <!-- 0.25.0 --> is used for alert handling and routing. It receives alerts from Prometheus and routes them to the appropriate notification channels.

- **Configuration**: Alertmanager is configured with alert rules and notification channels.
- **Alert Routing**: Alerts are routed to PagerDuty, Slack, and email based on severity and category.
- **Notification Channels**: Notification channels are configured to send alerts to the appropriate teams and individuals.

### Exporters and Agents

Various exporters and agents are used for metrics collection:

- **node_exporter <!-- 1.5.0 -->**: Collects system metrics from servers.
- **blackbox_exporter**: Probes external endpoints for availability and performance.
- **Custom Exporters**: Collects application-specific metrics.

    try:
        # Process the request
        result = process_request(request)
        success = True
        status_code = 200
    except Exception as e:
        success = False
        status_code = 500
        # Handle the exception
    finally:
        duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
        record_api_metrics(
            endpoint=request.path,
            method=request.method,
            status_code=status_code,
            duration_ms=duration_ms,
            success=success,
            trace_id=request.headers.get('X-Trace-ID')
        )
    return result
```

#### Recording Form Submission Metrics

```python
from app.monitoring.metrics import record_form_submission_metrics

def handle_form_submission(form_data):
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        # Process the form submission
        result = process_form(form_data)
        success = True
    except Exception as e:
        success = False
        # Handle the exception
    finally:
        duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
        record_form_submission_metrics(
            form_type=form_data.get('form_type', 'unknown'),
            submission_duration_ms=duration_ms,
            success=success,
            trace_id=form_data.get('trace_id')
        )
    return result
```

#### Recording File Upload Metrics

```python
from app.monitoring.metrics import record_file_upload_metrics

def handle_file_upload(file_data):
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        # Process the file upload
        result = process_upload(file_data)
        success = True
    except Exception as e:
        success = False
        # Handle the exception

# Get the current value of a metric
curl -G 'http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query' --data-urlencode 'query=up{job="web-tier"}'

# Get the values of a metric over time
curl -G 'http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query_range' \
  --data-urlencode 'query=rate(http_requests_total{job="api-tier"}[5m])' \
  --data-urlencode 'start=2023-06-01T00:00:00Z' \
  --data-urlencode 'end=2023-06-02T00:00:00Z' \
