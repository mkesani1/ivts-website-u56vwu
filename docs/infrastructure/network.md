## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the network architecture for the IndiVillage.com website. It covers the design principles, implementation details, and operational aspects of the networking infrastructure that supports the company's AI-as-a-service offerings and social impact mission.

### Network Design Principles

The network architecture for IndiVillage.com is designed based on the following core principles:

1. **Security by Design**: Multi-layered security approach with defense in depth
2. **High Availability**: Redundant components across multiple availability zones
3. **Scalability**: Ability to scale network capacity with growing demand
4. **Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Balanced approach to performance and cost
6. **Operational Excellence**: Simplified management and monitoring
7. **Compliance**: Adherence to security and regulatory requirements

### Network Architecture Overview

The IndiVillage.com network architecture follows a multi-tier, multi-region design implemented on AWS. Key characteristics include:

- **Multi-region deployment** across US East (primary) and US West (secondary)
- **Multi-AZ configuration** within each region for high availability
- **Segmented network tiers** for web, application, and data layers
- **Public and private subnets** for appropriate access control
- **Secure connectivity** between components and external systems
- **Global content delivery** through CDN
- **DDoS protection** and web application firewall integration

## VPC Architecture

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture provides the foundation for the IndiVillage.com network infrastructure, creating isolated network environments for different deployment stages.

### VPC Design

Each environment (development, staging, production) has its own VPC with the following configuration:

- **CIDR Block**: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IP addresses)
- **DNS Support**: Enabled for internal DNS resolution
- **DNS Hostnames**: Enabled for automatic hostname assignment
- **Tenancy**: Default for cost optimization

The production environment includes a secondary VPC in the disaster recovery region with similar configuration but different CIDR range to avoid overlap in case of VPC peering.

### Subnet Architecture

Each VPC is divided into multiple subnets across availability zones to support different tiers of the application:

- **Public Subnets**: Host internet-facing resources such as load balancers, NAT gateways, and bastion hosts
- **Private Web Tier Subnets**: Host web server instances with access to the internet via NAT gateways
- **Private App Tier Subnets**: Host application server instances with no direct internet access
- **Private Data Tier Subnets**: Host database instances with strict access controls

Subnets are distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability, with a minimum of 2 AZs in non-production environments and 3 AZs in production.

**Subnet CIDR Allocation**:
- Public Subnets: 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24
- Private Web Tier: 10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24
- Private App Tier: 10.0.20.0/24, 10.0.21.0/24, 10.0.22.0/24
- Private Data Tier: 10.0.30.0/24, 10.0.31.0/24, 10.0.32.0/24

### Routing Configuration

Routing tables control traffic flow between subnets and external networks:

- **Public Subnet Route Tables**: Route internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway
- **Private Subnet Route Tables**: Route internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to NAT Gateways in public subnets
- **Data Tier Route Tables**: No route to the internet, only internal VPC communication

Additional routes are configured for VPC endpoints, VPC peering, and transit gateways as needed.

### Internet Connectivity

Internet connectivity is provided through the following components:

- **Internet Gateway**: Attached to each VPC to allow communication between instances in the VPC and the internet
- **NAT Gateways**: Deployed in public subnets (one per AZ in production, single in non-production) to allow outbound internet access for instances in private subnets
- **Elastic IPs**: Associated with NAT Gateways and other public-facing resources

This configuration allows controlled internet access while maintaining security for private resources.

### VPC Endpoints

VPC Endpoints provide private connectivity to AWS services without traversing the public internet:

- **Gateway Endpoints**: Used for S3 and DynamoDB (free of charge)
  - s3: For secure access to S3 buckets
  - dynamodb: For secure access to DynamoDB tables

- **Interface Endpoints**: Used for other AWS services
  - ecr.api: For pulling container images
  - ecr.dkr: For Docker registry access
  - secretsmanager: For secure access to secrets
  - logs: For CloudWatch Logs access
  - monitoring: For CloudWatch Metrics access

VPC Endpoints improve security by keeping traffic within the AWS network and can reduce data transfer costs.

## Network Security

Network security is implemented through multiple layers of controls to protect resources and data.

### Security Groups

Security groups act as virtual firewalls at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic:

- **Web Tier Security Group**:
  - Inbound: HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from internet
  - Outbound: All traffic

- **Application Tier Security Group**:
  - Inbound: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and API port (8000) from Web Tier
  - Outbound: All traffic

- **Database Tier Security Group**:
  - Inbound: PostgreSQL (5432) from Application Tier
  - Outbound: All traffic

- **Cache Security Group**:
  - Inbound: Redis (6379) from Application Tier
  - Outbound: All traffic

- **Bastion Host Security Group**:
  - Inbound: SSH (22) from specified IP ranges
  - Outbound: All traffic

Security groups follow the principle of least privilege, allowing only necessary traffic between components.

### Network ACLs

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level:

- **Public Subnet NACLs**:
  - Inbound: Allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), ephemeral ports (1024-65535)
  - Outbound: Allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), ephemeral ports (1024-65535)

- **Private Web/App Subnet NACLs**:
  - Inbound: Allow all traffic from VPC CIDR, ephemeral ports from internet
  - Outbound: Allow all traffic to VPC CIDR, HTTP/HTTPS to internet

- **Data Tier Subnet NACLs**:
  - Inbound: Allow database ports from VPC CIDR, ephemeral ports from VPC CIDR
  - Outbound: Allow ephemeral ports to VPC CIDR

NACLs are stateless, requiring explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.

### Web Application Firewall

AWS WAF is deployed in front of the application to protect against common web exploits:

- **Rule Sets**:
  - OWASP Top 10 protection rules
  - Rate-based rules to prevent brute force attacks
  - IP reputation lists to block known malicious IPs

## Network Security Best Practices

Best practices for maintaining network security.

### Security Group Management

Best practices for security group configuration and management:

- **Least Privilege**: Allow only necessary traffic
- **Service Grouping**: Group similar services under the same security group
- **Tagging**: Use consistent tagging for easy identification
- **Documentation**: Document the purpose of each rule
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and clean up unused rules
- **Change Control**: Implement change control process for modifications
- **Reference by ID**: Reference security groups by ID rather than CIDR blocks where possible

### Network Monitoring and Logging

Best practices for network monitoring and logging:

- **Enable Flow Logs**: Capture network traffic for analysis
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs in a central location
- **Log Retention**: Define appropriate retention periods
- **Regular Analysis**: Regularly analyze logs for anomalies
- **Alerting**: Configure alerts for suspicious activity
- **Automated Response**: Implement automated responses for common issues
- **Encryption**: Encrypt log data at rest and in transit

### Network Access Control

Best practices for controlling network access:

- **Bastion Hosts**: Use bastion hosts for administrative access
- **VPN**: Implement VPN for secure remote access
- **Private Endpoints**: Use VPC endpoints for AWS service access
- **Jump Servers**: Implement jump servers for accessing sensitive resources
- **Network Segmentation**: Segment network by function and security level
- **Default Deny**: Implement default deny with explicit allows
- **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit access controls

### DDoS Mitigation

Best practices for DDoS mitigation:

- **Shield Advanced**: Enable for critical workloads
- **CloudFront**: Use as a buffer against direct attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement at multiple layers
- **Over-provisioning**: Ensure capacity for traffic spikes
- **Traffic Profiling**: Understand normal traffic patterns
- **Response Plan**: Develop and test DDoS response plan
- **Post-attack Analysis**: Analyze attacks to improve defenses

## Troubleshooting

Procedures for troubleshooting common network issues.

### Connectivity Issues

Steps for troubleshooting connectivity problems:

1. **Verify Security Groups**: Check inbound and outbound rules
2. **Check NACLs**: Verify subnet NACL rules
3. **Routing Tables**: Confirm correct route table associations
4. **Internet Gateway**: Ensure proper attachment and configuration
5. **NAT Gateway**: Verify status and elastic IP association
6. **DNS Resolution**: Check DNS settings and resolution
7. **Load Balancer**: Check target group health and routing
8. **Instance Health**: Verify instance status and network interfaces

### Performance Issues

Steps for troubleshooting network performance problems:

1. **Bandwidth Utilization**: Check for network saturation
2. **Instance Types**: Verify network performance of instance types
3. **Load Balancer Metrics**: Analyze request counts and latency
4. **CloudFront Cache Hit Ratio**: Check for low cache hit rates
5. **Connection Tracking**: Look for connection tracking limits
6. **MTU Settings**: Verify MTU configuration
7. **Network ACL Impact**: Check for overly restrictive NACLs
8. **Cross-AZ Traffic**: Analyze impact of cross-AZ communication

### Security Group Issues

Steps for troubleshooting security group problems:

1. **Rule Verification**: Check specific port and protocol rules
2. **Reference Chains**: Follow security group reference chains
3. **Default Deny**: Remember all traffic is denied by default
4. **Ephemeral Ports**: Ensure return traffic is allowed
5. **VPC Peering**: Verify security groups in peered VPCs
6. **Rule Limits**: Check for security group rule limits
7. **Recent Changes**: Review recent security group changes
8. **Flow Logs**: Analyze VPC flow logs for rejected traffic

### Load Balancer Issues

Steps for troubleshooting load balancer problems:

1. **Health Checks**: Verify target health check configuration
2. **Target Registration**: Confirm targets are registered correctly
3. **Security Groups**: Check load balancer and target security groups
4. **Sticky Sessions**: Verify sticky session configuration
5. **SSL/TLS**: Check certificate validity and configuration
6. **Routing Rules**: Verify listener rules and priority
7. **Access Logs**: Analyze load balancer access logs
8. **CloudWatch Metrics**: Review load balancer metrics
