- Purpose: Pre-production validation and testing
- Configuration: Similar to production but at lower scale
- Resource sizing: t3.large instances, multi-AZ database
- Access: Limited to development team, QA, and project managers
- Update frequency: Several times per week

**Production Environment**:
- Purpose: Live environment for end users
- Configuration: Optimized for performance and user load
- Resource sizing: m5.large instances, multi-AZ with read replicas
- Access: Strictly limited to operations team and automated processes
- Update frequency: Weekly or bi-weekly (scheduled releases)

```

The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process, with appropriate gates and approvals for production deployments.

## 9.3 Deployment Strategies
Different deployment strategies are used for different environments:

- **Development**: Rolling updates for simplicity and speed
- **Staging**: Blue-green deployment for testing production-like deployments
- **Production**: Blue-green deployment with traffic shifting for zero-downtime updates

These strategies ensure reliable deployments with minimal user impact.

## 9.4 Configuration Management
Configuration is managed through a combination of:

- **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration for applications
- **AWS Parameter Store**: Secure storage of configuration values
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secure storage of sensitive credentials
- **Terraform Variables**: Infrastructure configuration

This approach ensures secure and consistent configuration across environments.

## 9.5 Rollback Procedures
Automated rollback procedures are in place for deployment failures:

- **Development**: Manual rollback if issues are detected
- **Staging**: Automatic rollback if tests fail
- **Production**: Immediate automatic rollback by shifting traffic back to the previous version

These procedures ensure that service disruptions are minimized in case of deployment issues.
