# CI/CD Overview

The IndiVillage.com website uses a comprehensive Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the application. This document provides detailed information about the CI/CD pipeline, including the build process, testing strategy, deployment workflows, and environment promotion.

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and follows industry best practices for automation, testing, and deployment. It supports the full software development lifecycle from code commit to production deployment, with appropriate controls and validations at each stage.

```

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by code changes in the repository and automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to the appropriate environment. The pipeline is designed to catch issues early in the development process and ensure that only high-quality code reaches production.

## Branching Strategy
The IndiVillage.com repository uses a modified GitFlow branching strategy:

**Main Branches**:
- `main`: Production-ready code, deployed to the production environment
- `staging`: Pre-production code, deployed to the staging environment
- `develop`: Development code, deployed to the development environment

**Supporting Branches**:
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new development
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches for non-critical fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches for critical production issues

**Branch Protection Rules**:
- All branches require pull requests for changes
- `main` and `staging` branches require approvals
- CI checks must pass before merging
- Linear history enforced (no merge commits)

**Workflow**:
1. Developers create feature branches from `develop`
2. Pull requests are created to merge back to `develop`
3. Changes are promoted from `develop` to `staging` for testing
4. Changes are promoted from `staging` to `main` for production
5. Hotfixes are created from `main` and merged back to `main`, then backported to `staging` and `develop`

This branching strategy supports the environment promotion workflow and ensures that changes flow through the appropriate testing and validation steps before reaching production.

## Pipeline Triggers
The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by various events in the GitHub repository:

**Continuous Integration Triggers**:
- Pull requests to `develop`, `staging`, or `main` branches
- Direct pushes to `develop`, `staging`, or `main` branches

**Continuous Deployment Triggers**:
- Successful CI builds on the `develop` branch (automatic)
- Successful CI builds on the `staging` branch (automatic)
- Successful CI builds on the `main` branch (manual approval required)
- Manual workflow dispatch for specific deployments

**Exclusions**:
- Documentation changes (files in `docs/` directory or `.md` files)
- Changes to `.github/` directory that don't affect workflows

These triggers ensure that the CI/CD pipeline runs automatically when code changes are made, while providing appropriate controls for production deployments.

# Continuous Integration

The Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline automatically builds and tests code changes to ensure quality and prevent issues from reaching deployment environments.

## CI Workflow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GitHub as GitHub
    participant CI as CI Pipeline
    
    Dev->>GitHub: Push code changes
    GitHub->>CI: Trigger CI workflow
    
    CI->>CI: Checkout code
    CI->>CI: Install dependencies
    
    par Frontend CI
        CI->>CI: Lint frontend code
        CI->>CI: Run frontend unit tests
        CI->>CI: Build frontend application
        CI->>CI: Build frontend Docker image
        CI->>CI: Scan frontend image
    and Backend CI
        CI->>CI: Lint backend code
        CI->>CI: Run backend unit tests
        CI->>CI: Build backend application
        CI->>CI: Build backend Docker image
        CI->>CI: Scan backend image
    end
    
    CI->>CI: Run integration tests
    CI->>CI: Run security scans
    
    alt Tests Pass
        CI->>GitHub: Report success
        GitHub->>Dev: Notify success
    else Tests Fail
        CI->>GitHub: Report failure
        GitHub->>Dev: Notify failure
    end
```

The CI workflow runs automatically when code changes are pushed to the repository or pull requests are created. It performs a series of checks and tests to ensure code quality and prevent issues from reaching deployment environments.

## Build Process
The build process compiles the application code and creates Docker images for deployment:

**Frontend Build**:
1. Install Node.js dependencies
2. Run ESLint for code quality
3. Run TypeScript type checking
4. Run unit tests with Jest
5. Build the Next.js application
6. Build Docker image with the compiled application

**Backend Build**:
1. Install Python dependencies
2. Run flake8, black, isort, and mypy for code quality
3. Run unit tests with pytest
4. Verify application startup
5. Build Docker image with the application

**Docker Images**:
- Frontend image: Based on Node.js for build, Nginx for serving
- Backend image: Based on Python with required dependencies

The build process creates Docker images that are tagged with the environment name and commit SHA for traceability. These images are pushed to Amazon ECR for deployment.

## Testing Strategy
The CI pipeline includes comprehensive testing to ensure code quality and prevent issues:

**Linting and Static Analysis**:
- Frontend: ESLint, TypeScript type checking
- Backend: flake8, black, isort, mypy

**Unit Testing**:
- Frontend: Jest with React Testing Library
- Backend: pytest with coverage reporting

**Integration Testing**:
- API endpoint testing
- Component integration testing
- Database interaction testing

**Security Testing**:
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing) with CodeQL
- Dependency scanning for vulnerabilities
- Docker image scanning with Trivy
- Secret detection

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Unit test coverage: 80% minimum
- Critical paths: 90% minimum

Tests are run in parallel where possible to minimize pipeline execution time. Test results and coverage reports are stored as artifacts for review.

## Quality Gates
The CI pipeline includes several quality gates that must be passed before code can proceed to deployment:

**Code Quality Gates**:
- Linting must pass with no errors
- Type checking must pass with no errors
- Unit tests must pass with required coverage
- Integration tests must pass

**Security Gates**:
- No critical or high vulnerabilities in dependencies
- No critical or high vulnerabilities in Docker images
- No secrets detected in code
- CodeQL analysis must pass

**Performance Gates**:
- Frontend build size within limits
- API response time within thresholds

If any quality gate fails, the CI pipeline will fail and prevent deployment. This ensures that only high-quality code proceeds to deployment environments.

## Artifact Management
The CI pipeline produces several artifacts that are used in the deployment process:

**Docker Images**:
- Frontend image: `indivillage/frontend:<environment>-<commit-sha>`
- Backend image: `indivillage/backend:<environment>-<commit-sha>`

**Build Artifacts**:
- Frontend build output
- Backend build output
- Test reports
- Coverage reports
- Security scan reports

**Storage Locations**:
- Docker images: Amazon ECR
- Build artifacts: GitHub Actions artifacts
- Reports: GitHub Actions artifacts

Artifacts are retained for a limited time (30 days) for debugging and auditing purposes. Docker images are retained according to ECR lifecycle policies.

# Continuous Deployment

        CD->>Infra: Update infrastructure (Terraform)
        CD->>App: Deploy to blue environment
        CD->>Tests: Run comprehensive tests
        Tests->>CD: Report results
        CD->>App: Canary deployment (10% traffic)
        CD->>CD: Monitor for issues
        CD->>App: Swap blue and green environments
    end
    
    alt Deployment Success
        CD->>CD: Notify success
    else Deployment Failure
        CD->>App: Rollback deployment
        CD->>CD: Notify failure
    end
```

The deployment workflow varies by environment, with increasing levels of validation and control as changes move toward production. This ensures that only high-quality, validated changes reach production.

## Development Deployment
Deployment to the development environment is fully automated and occurs after successful CI builds on the `develop` branch.

**Deployment Process**:
1. Build and tag Docker images
2. Push images to Amazon ECR
3. Update infrastructure using Terraform
4. Deploy new version to ECS
5. Run smoke tests
6. Notify team of deployment status

**Deployment Strategy**: Rolling update

**Rollback Strategy**: Manual rollback if issues are detected

**Post-Deployment Validation**:
- Automated smoke tests
- Basic health checks

The development deployment process is optimized for speed and developer feedback, with minimal manual intervention required.

## Staging Deployment
Deployment to the staging environment is automated but includes more comprehensive testing and validation. It uses a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime and enable easy rollback.

**Deployment Process**:
1. Determine deployment version (latest successful development build or specified version)
2. Tag Docker images for staging
3. Update infrastructure using Terraform
4. Deploy new version to blue environment
5. Run comprehensive tests against blue environment
6. If tests pass, swap blue and green environments
7. Update green environment to match blue
8. Notify team of deployment status

**Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployment

**Rollback Strategy**: Automatic rollback if tests fail, manual rollback option available

**Post-Deployment Validation**:
- Automated smoke tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
- Security scans

The staging deployment process includes more comprehensive testing and validation to catch issues before production deployment.

## Production Deployment
Deployment to the production environment requires manual approval and includes the most comprehensive testing and validation. It uses a blue-green deployment strategy with canary testing to minimize risk and enable easy rollback.

**Deployment Process**:
1. Verify staging version exists and has passed all tests
2. Request approval for production deployment
3. Wait for manual approval
4. Tag Docker images for production (including secondary region)
5. Update infrastructure using Terraform
6. Deploy new version to blue environment
7. Run comprehensive tests against blue environment
8. If tests pass, implement canary deployment (10% traffic to blue)
9. Monitor for issues during canary period
10. If no issues, swap blue and green environments
11. Update green environment to match blue
12. Update secondary region
13. Notify team of deployment status

**Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployment with canary testing

**Rollback Strategy**: Immediate automatic rollback by shifting traffic back to green environment

**Post-Deployment Validation**:
- Automated smoke tests
- Performance tests
- Canary monitoring
- Error rate monitoring

The production deployment process includes the most comprehensive testing and validation to minimize the risk of issues affecting end users.

## Rollback Procedures
The CI/CD pipeline includes automated and manual rollback procedures to quickly recover from deployment issues:

**Automated Rollback Triggers**:
- Failed smoke tests
- Failed integration tests
- Failed performance tests
- Error rate exceeding threshold during canary period

**Rollback Process by Environment**:

**Development**:
- Manual rollback by redeploying previous version

**Staging**:
- Automatic rollback if tests fail
- Return traffic to green environment
- Stop blue environment services

**Production**:
- Automatic rollback if tests or canary monitoring fail
- Return traffic to green environment
- Stop blue environment services

**Rollback Verification**:
- Health checks after rollback
- Notification of rollback status

Rollback procedures are tested regularly to ensure they work when needed.

## Deployment Notifications
The CI/CD pipeline sends notifications at various stages of the deployment process:

**Notification Channels**:
- Slack channels for team communication
