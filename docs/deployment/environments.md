Access to environments is granted based on role and need, following the principle of least privilege. Higher environments have stricter access controls.

### Authentication Methods
Different authentication methods are used depending on the access type and environment:

**AWS Console and API Access**:
- IAM users with MFA for human access
- IAM roles for service access
- Temporary credentials via AWS SSO

**SSH Access**:
- SSH keys for authentication
- Bastion host for access to private instances
- MFA required for production access

**Application Access**:
- Development: Basic authentication or simplified login
- Staging: Full authentication system
- Production: Full authentication system with MFA for admin access

**Database Access**:
- Development: Direct access with credentials
- Staging: Access via bastion host
- Production: Access via bastion host with approval

Authentication methods are appropriate to the sensitivity of the environment and access type.

### Network Security
Network security controls protect the environments from unauthorized access:

**VPC Configuration**:
- Public subnets for load balancers and bastion hosts
- Private subnets for application and database
- Network ACLs for subnet-level security

**Security Groups**:
- Load balancer security groups
- Application security groups
- Database security groups
- Bastion host security groups

**External Access**:
- HTTPS only for web access
- API Gateway for API access
- VPN for administrative access

**WAF Configuration**:
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- Rate limiting
- Custom rules for application-specific protection

Network security is configured to provide defense in depth while allowing necessary access.

### Data Protection
Data protection measures safeguard sensitive information:

**Data Classification**:
- Public: No restrictions
- Internal: Limited to authorized users
- Confidential: Strict access controls
- Restricted: Highest level of protection

**Encryption**:
- Encryption in transit via TLS
- Encryption at rest for databases
- Encryption at rest for file storage
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data

**Data Handling**:
- Development: Synthetic or anonymized data
- Staging: Anonymized production-like data
- Production: Full production data with strict controls

**Data Retention**:
- Automated data lifecycle management
- Retention periods based on data type
- Secure deletion when no longer needed

Data protection measures are aligned with the sensitivity of the data and compliance requirements.

### Security Monitoring
Security monitoring ensures that security events are detected and addressed:

**Monitoring Tools**:
- AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
- AWS Config for configuration compliance
- AWS CloudTrail for API activity monitoring
- AWS Security Hub for security posture management

**Log Analysis**:
- Centralized logging
- Log retention according to policy
- Automated log analysis
- Alert generation for security events

**Vulnerability Management**:
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Automated patching where possible
- Vulnerability tracking and remediation

**Incident Response**:
- Defined incident response process
- Escalation procedures
- Communication plan
- Post-incident analysis

Security monitoring is comprehensive and appropriate to the environment's sensitivity.
