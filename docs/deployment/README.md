```

The deployment architecture follows a GitFlow-based workflow with automated CI/CD pipelines for each environment. Code changes flow from development to staging to production, with appropriate testing and approval gates at each stage.

## Key Components

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Source Control | GitHub | Version control and collaboration |
| CI Workflows | GitHub Actions | Automated building and testing |
| CD Workflows | GitHub Actions | Automated deployment to environments |
| Container Registry | Amazon ECR | Storage for Docker images |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform | Automated infrastructure management |
| Orchestration | AWS ECS | Container orchestration and management |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch, Grafana | Deployment monitoring and alerting |

## Deployment Principles

The IndiVillage.com deployment process follows these core principles:

1. **Automation First**: All build, test, and deployment processes are fully automated to minimize manual intervention and human error.

2. **Quality Gates**: Code must pass automated tests, security scans, and code reviews before proceeding to the next stage.

3. **Environment Parity**: Development, staging, and production environments are configured as similarly as possible to ensure consistent behavior.

4. **Progressive Deployment**: Changes flow from development to staging to production with appropriate testing at each stage.

5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging provide visibility into the deployment process and application performance.

6. **Rollback Capability**: All deployments can be quickly rolled back if issues are detected.

7. **Security Integration**: Security scanning and testing are integrated throughout the pipeline.
